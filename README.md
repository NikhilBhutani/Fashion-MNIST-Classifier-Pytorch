# Fashion MNIST Classification

I was studying a course on udacity they gave a task to classify different fashion images and also train the model to get the maximum
accuracy. 

### Tech

Fashion MNIST Classification uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [numpy] - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
* [pytorch] - An open source deep learning platform that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment
* [matplotlib] - Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms
* [torchvision] - The torchvision package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision
* [python] - Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language

And of course Photo Gallery itself is open source .
